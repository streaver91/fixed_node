# This plot is for 10 different random Hamiltonians and corresponding approximate trial wavefunctions
# This plot demonstrates a few things:
# 1) As expected the FN-DMC gradient has much smaller magnitude than the VMC gradient
# 2) The VMC gradient and the VMC expression for the gradient evaluated for the DMC distribution are very close
# 3) The approximate DMC gradients are accurate, i.e, the zero of the true DMC gradient is much closer to the zero of the approx. DMC gradients than to the zero of the VMC gradient 
# 4) The new approximation for the FN-DMC gradient is more accurate than the FU2000 approximation.
#    In particular, FU2000 sometimes has a 2nd spurious zero.
